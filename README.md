## Problem Statement:

The purpose of an effective Emergency medical system is to provide _timely medical care to prevent death or disability_.
Delays in arrival to the Emergency Department (ED), and in receiving treatment can lead to **severe negative outcomes and poor prognosis**.
When we look at delay in treatment, one of the biggest contribution factors that comes to mind is the **breakdown in communication**.
Delays in getting care can lead to: _Increased emotional distress, Increased complications, Higher treatment costs and Increased hospitalizations_

## Our Solution:

There is a **golden hour** between life and death.
The golden hour is the period of time following a traumatic injury.
It is well established that the person's chances of survival are greatest if they receive care within a short period of time after a severe injury.

The main aim of our product is to **utilize the golden hour of the patient by intimating the patient’s condition from the ambulance to the _Accident and Emergency (A & E)_ department** of the nearby hospital before the arrival of the patient.
This helps them to know completely about the condition of the patient and helps them in _arranging the emergency room and other facilities_ before the arrival of the patient.
So that they can be **treated without any delay** when they reach the hospital.
