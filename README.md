# `Prioritor`

## Problem Statement :
The purpose of an effective Emergency medical system is to provide *timely medical care to prevent death or disability*. 
Delays in arrival to the Emergency Department (ED), and in receiving treatment can lead to **severe negative outcomes and poor prognosis**. 
When we look at delay in treatment, one of the biggest contribution factors that comes to mind is the **breakdown in communication**.
Delays in getting care can lead to: *Increased emotional distress, Increased complications, Higher treatment costs and Increased hospitalizations*

## Our Solution : 
There is a **golden hour** between life and death. 
The golden hour is the period of time following a traumatic injury. 
It is well established that the person's chances of survival are greatest if they receive care within a short period of time after a severe injury. 
The main aim of our product is to **utilize the golden hour of the patient by intimating the patient’s condition from the ambulance to the *Accident and Emergency (A & E)* department** of the nearby hospital. 
This intimation helps the hospital to know completely about the condition of  the patient and helps the doctors in *arranging the emergency room and other facilities* before the arrival of patient at the hospital.
So that they can be **treated without any delay** at once they reach the hospital.
